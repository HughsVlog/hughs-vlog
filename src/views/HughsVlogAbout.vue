    </header>
    <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Hugh. I started this video blog to document what it‚Äôs like to build a company, day by day, from the very beginning. I want to take this typically very private process and open it up to everyone. Imagine if you were able to watch Steve Jobs and Wozniak grow Apple from a garage project into the largest tech company in the world? I may not reach that level of success; I may fail spectacularly, but at least there will be a record of the attempt.</p>
    <p>For me, it‚Äôs self-improvement by way of radical transparency, and the public accountability that comes with that. For you: you get to my virtual co-founders. I‚Äôll be listening to your feedback in the comments and chat room every step of the way. I also endeavor to make the series equal parts informative and entertaining‚Äîso whether you‚Äôre a fellow founder looking to compare notes, or just an Average Joe/Josephine killing time on your lunch break, there‚Äôs something in it for you.</p>
    <p>Join me as I attempt to achieve financial independence, put a dent in the universe, and squeeze the most I can out of life along the way.</p>
    <p><i>Full disclosure, though: I‚Äôve got ADHD. The legit kind. It makes me allergic to being put in a box. So in addition to ‚Äúentrepreneur‚Äù, I wear many other hats: web developer, UX designer, comedian, filmmaker, writer‚Ä¶ the list goes on. Since this is a daily documentary series, it will inevitably veer off-topic into these other interests at times. But I‚Äôll be sure to always bring it back to my journey as a startup founder.</i></p>

      <p>Hypervideo‚Äîonline video annotated with time-based links and other widgets‚Äîis on the rise. It opens up a world of immersive storytelling, such as choose-your-own-story films, which boast high audience engagement. Frustratingly, there is no free, standardized solution for creating and distributing hypervideo in active development. Current offerings are proprietary, requiring recurring payments and vendor lock-in to use. This hinders cash-strapped visual artists, and silos metadata that could be useful in search and beyond.</p>
      <p>Enter&nbsp;<a href="https://redblue.video/">RedBlue</a>. We (well, just me at the moment) enable more people to produce hypervideo by democratizing the technology behind it. We author an open specification, HVML (Hypervideo Markup Language), which aims to be the HTML of video. In conjunction, we develop the RedBlue JavaScript player, which brings the immersive features of HVML to any website.</p>
      <p>These core offerings will be completely free to download and use. Monetization will be achieved through premium products and services based on these technologies, such as plug-ins and support.</p>
      <p>There are some other exciting products on the roadmap, but for now‚Ä¶ ü§ê</p>

        <h3 class="h h--3">Why do you need Patreon money?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>I‚Äôve been a professional web developer for over 10 years now. In that time, I‚Äôve held a handful of ‚Äúreal jobs‚Äù, but my ADHD has made them a nightmare to deal with. I have an unpredictable sleep schedule, I lose interest in assignments quickly, and I have a hard time coloring inside the lines of management. They say entrepreneurs make terrible employees, and I feel that. As a result, I haven‚Äôt called any job home for more than a few months at a time. Which has made saving up a nest egg with which to fund this dream of mine something of a herculean task.</p>
      <p>So right now, I find myself a walking Millennial stereotype: 30 years old, unemployed, and living off of Annie‚Äôs mac &amp; cheese at my mom‚Äôs house. Until I can afford a cheap apartment, the money will just be used to cover basic necessities, like buying more pasta. There will be the occasional business expense, like domain name renewal or website hosting fees, but nothing crazy. As the pot grows, though, I‚Äôll be able to put more and more of it into the business, such as paying for a desk at a co-working space, or hiring a videographer so I can focus more on founding than filming. I intend to stick to Lean Startup principles throughout‚ÄîI certainly won‚Äôt be springing for Aeron chairs from the get-go.</p>

        <h3 class="h h--3">Why Patreon? Why not pitch VCs like other startups?</h3>
      </header>
      <p>Shows like <cite>Shark Tank</cite> make it seem like there‚Äôs only one way to fund a company: asking venture capitalists to write you a fat check in exchange for some equity in the business. This has advantages over a traditional bank loan, in that you can procure substantially larger investments, you don‚Äôt have to pay any of it back, and the investors act as mentors to the fledgling founder. With VC money in the bank, a company can afford to take bold risks early on, without having to worry about revenue forecasts until after they‚Äôve become the next Facebook. Sounds nice, right?</p>
      <p>But there‚Äôs more to the story that doesn‚Äôt get talked about as much. First off, most VCs aren‚Äôt doling out their own money like Mark Cuban is. Much like founders, VCs raise their own capital from richer, meta-VCs called LPs (limited partners): the likes of insurance firms, investment banks, pension funds, and private billionaires. LPs entrust their money to VCs the same way one might entrust their 401(k) to a hedge fund manager, the idea being to pick companies that look like winners in order to maximize ROI for the fund; the VCs making their money in management fees. If a startup goes public or gets bought, the VCs and LPs both stand to make a killing.</p>
      <p>The problem with this is that VCs ultimately serve their own investors, not the founders in whom they invest. LPs, despite being largely anonymous, can indirectly change the direction of a founder‚Äôs business in order to serve profits. VCs take 20‚Äì40% equity and a board seat, meaning that outside of day-to-day decisions, they call the shots. Including firing the founder from their own company if they don‚Äôt see exponential growth. A stabler, linear growth? Not good enough. After all, they‚Äôre looking for a minimum of 10√ó their money back (with an outside chance of 100√ó) in the span of 7-odd years in order to make the investment worthwhile. While they don‚Äôt want you to fail, it‚Äôs an acceptable loss if you run out of money and fold without becoming Facebook. Any given investee is only one asset in the fund‚Äôs diversified portfolio.</p>
      <p>And even if I wanted to go down this route, it would still take 3‚Äì9 months or more of landing pitch meetings with VCs and getting rejected by most of them before I could walk away with a check. Pitching is effectively a full-time job, so I would need to <em>already have money to live off of</em>. Yet if I had money to live off of, I wouldn‚Äôt need to raise a round in the first place, since food and shelter are my only overhead costs right now.</p>
      <p>But the biggest reason I‚Äôm avoiding VC funding? I‚Äôm looking to build a different kind of company. One that serves the public good, rather than simply maximizing profits. By being funded by Viewers Like You rather than the 1%, my company‚Äôs interests will be aligned with the interests of my users. That is, the filmmakers and app developers who will craft the future of visual storytelling. And to make sure they‚Äôre always considered, I plan to incorporate RedBlue as a Public Benefit Corporation.</p>
